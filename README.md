# Muscovy Duck mod for Stardew Valley

This mod is a tribute for my fallen warrior, [Dug the Duck](https://imgur.com/gallery/DMveE).

It changes the default Duck pallet into a Muscovy duck.

No tie this time.

# Instalation:

Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)

Install [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)

Throw the Muscovy paste into the Mods folder inside Stardew Valley folder.

Have fun with my bro.
